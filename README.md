## Install

At the terminal, first you must clone the project (here we use the HTTP protocol, but if you prefer you can copy the project's SSH protocol link): 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/antoninocalisto/alliedBr.git
```

2. Access the project root folder with the command:

```sh
cd alliedBr/
```

3. To install the project's dependencies, you just have to be inside the project folder (root - as indicated in the previous step) and run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

4. Once all the dependencies are installed, the frontend application server must be started, which by default will be executed on port 4200 (http://localhost:4200/), whose command for this action is::

```sh
npm start
```

5. Once this is done, access the following link to view the application:

```sh
http://localhost:4200/
```
